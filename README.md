# A Journey through Azure Networking

## Overview
Organizations often begin the cloud journey with simple requirements. These requirements grow as an organization scales, matures, and migrates critical data and workloads. As more requirements are introduced, the architecture of the an organization's cloud deployment becomes more complex.

This repository contains a collection of core networking patterns starting from basic to advanced. The goal is to assist customers with picking the right pattern for their stage of the journey. Each pattern includes a summary, benefits and considerations, and diagrams providing examples of the patterns and what the route tables could look like.

For the purposes of this repository, north and south traffic is traffic ingressing or egressing to the Internet. East and west is traffic ingressing or egressing between on-premises and Azure or between workloads running in different virtual networks in Azure.

**Note that in the patterns with firewalls, the firewalls are assumed to have a separate dedicated network interface in a management subnet. This is not shown in the diagrams.**

For detail on the traffic flows of the more complex network architectures listed here, reference [this repository](https://github.com/mattfeltonma/azure-networking-patterns).

## Patterns
### Single VNet And Single Subnet
![visual](images/singlevnetsinglesubnet.svg)

In this pattern there is a single virtual network with a single subnet all resources are placed in. 

*Benefits*
* All virtual machines in the same virtual network can communicate with each other using default system routes.
* Virtual machine communication within the subnet can be mediated a network security group.

*Considerations*
* Scaling this pattern can be a significant problem because subnets cannot be resized once network interfaces are associated with them.
* Managing network security groups for intra-subnet traffic can be prone to misconfigurations.
* All resources have direct access to the Internet through the default system route.
* This pattern does not allow for connectivity back on-premises.

### Single VNet And Multiple Subnets
![visual](images/singlevnetmultiplesubnet.svg)

In this pattern there is a single virtual network with multiple subnets.

This is a common pattern for proof-of-concepts for a single workload where there is no requirement for on-premises connectivity.

*Benefits*
* All virtual machines in the same virtual network can communicate with each other using default system routes.
* Virtual machine communication between subnets can be mediated with network security groups.

### Peered VNets And On-Premises Connectivity With Multiple Workloads
![visual](images/peervnetonprem.svg)

In this pattern each workload is its own virtual network and requires on-premises connectivity. 

#### Benefts
* On-premises connectivity is provided by a Virtual Network Gateway configured with either a site-to-site VPN or ExpressRoute connection. Routes can be exchanged between on-premises and Azure using BGP.
* On-premises connectivity for the peered virtual network is provided by [gateway transit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-peering-gateway-transit).

### Hub And Spoke With A Flat Network And Forced Tunneling
![visual](images/hubspokeflatft.svg)

In this pattern there is a dedicated virtual network used for on-premises connectivity which is shared with each workload that each have their own dedicated virtual network and there is a requirement to send Internet-bound traffic back on-premises for inspection, mediation, and/or logging.

This is a common pattern for organizations new to Azure that may have a significant capital investment in security appliances on-premises that are not yet fully depreciated and are comfortable mediating network traffic between workloads using network security groups.

*Benefits*

* Additional costs and latency will be incurred for egressing Internet-bound traffic back on-premises.

### Hub And Spoke With East and West Firewall And Forced Tunneling
![visual](images/hubspokeewft.svg)

In this pattern there is a dedicated virtual network used for on-premises connectivity which is shared with each workload that each have their own dedicated virtual network and there is a requirement to send Internet-bound traffic back on-premises for inspection, mediation, filtering, and/or logging. There is also a requirement for inspection, mediation, and/or logging for traffic between on-premises and workloads and for traffic between workloads but these activities must be performed by a firewall in Azure.

This pattern also uses a dedicated virtual network in a dedicated subscription for shared infrastructure services. These services can include Microsoft Active Directory, patching or update services, or logging services.

This is a common pattern for organizations new to Azure that may have a significant capital investment in security appliances on-premises that are not yet fully depreciated but want mediation, inspection, and/or centralized logging between workloads which is provided by a firewall in Azure.

Workloads each have a dedicated virtual network and are dual peered to both Internal Virtual Network and External Virtual Network.There is requirement for Internet-bound traffic, traffic between on-premises and Azure, and traffic between workloads in Azure to be mediated, inspected, and/or centrally logged by firewalls in Azure. There is a separate firewall stack for north/south traffic in the External Virtual Network and another for east/west in the Internal Virtual Network.

This pattern also uses a dedicated virtual network in a dedicated subscription for shared infrastructure services. These services can include Microsoft Active Directory, patching or update services, or logging services.

The pattern is complex and should only be used where there is a hard requirement to establish separate subscription-level boundaries and blast radiuses for east/west and north/south traffic. It should not used for the purposes of replicating traditional on-premises DMZ architectures. The previous two architectures can establish a DMZ-like architecture in a single virtual network.

*Benefits*
* North/south and east/west firewall have separate subscription-level blast radiuses.
* North/south and east/west traffic is distributed to two separate firewall stacks reducing the risk of a bottleneck.

* If connectivity from a branch site to a hub is lost, connectivity to the hub virtual networks the branch still has connection to will still be possible.
* Traffic to the Internet from the indirect spokes can be mediated and inspected by a 3rd party security appliance that is not supported to run in a VWAN Secure Hub.
* Traffic between indirect spokes both within the same region and in different regions can be mediated and inspected by a 3rd party security appliance that is not supported to run in a VWAN Secure Hub.
* Traffic to and from the branch and virtual network intra-hub can be mediated and inspected by a 3rd party security appliance that is not supported to run in a VWAN Secure Hub.

*Considerations*
* This is complex pattern that requires extensive knowledge of both general Azure networking and Azure VWAN.
* Maintaining the static routes on each connection can become operationally significant at scale. While the static route prefixes can be summarized when applied to the route tables, the connections do not allow for summarization.
